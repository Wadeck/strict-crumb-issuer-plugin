    Instead of checking the full URL, this option will force to check only the part of the URL that is after the context path.<br>
    As an example, if your form is displayed on <code>https://internal-url.com/jenkins/configureSecurity</code>, the submit handler will only check the <code>configureSecurity</code> part.<br>
